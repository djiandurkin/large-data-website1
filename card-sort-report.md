## Observations

Both participants were both adept at putting together the history aspect of the card sort. Genres seemed to be missed in between the two, however that would be normal to a person that does not follow a particular genre of music. Both participants were quite quick and thorough in completing the list. Interested that Freeman decided to remove the artist heading and flow Influential DJs into the history section.
