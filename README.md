# House Music

With the popularizations (and some say oversaturation) of the mushrooming EDM scene, more and more people are getting in to electronic music. However, EDM does owe its entire existence to a style of music that has survived over 25 years. House Music was one of the original forms of electronic dance music. Developed in Chicago, this sound has spawned different genres since the mid-to-late eighties, including: Chicago House, Acid House, Tech House, Electro House, Jackin House and numerous others.
