# House Music

House music, after enjoying significant underground and club-based success in Chicago from the early 1980s onwards, emerged into the UK mainstream pop market in the mid-to-late 80s. Popularity quickly followed in the rest of Europe, and it became a global phenomenon from the early-to-mid 90s onwards.[2] It proved to be a commercially successful genre and a more mainstream pop-based variation grew increasingly popular. Artists and groups such as Madonna,[2] Janet Jackson,[3] Björk, Kanye West,[4] and C+C Music Factory[2] incorporated the genre into their work. After enjoying significant success in the early to mid-90s, house music grew even larger during the second wave of progressive house (1999–2001). The genre has remained popular and fused into other popular subgenres, as the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll has been dominated by house DJs since the beginning of the polls. Today, house music remains popular in both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene while retaining a strong foothold on underground scenes across the globe.hrooming EDM scene, more and more people are getting in to electronic music. However, EDM does owe its entire existence to a style of music that has survived over 25 years. House Music was one of the original forms of electronic dance music. Developed in Chicago, this sound has spawned different genres since the mid-to-late eighties, including: Chicago House, Acid House, Tech House, Electro House, Jackin House and numerous others.
